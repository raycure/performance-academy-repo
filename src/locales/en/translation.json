			"Entry": "At Performance Fitness Academy, we provide both instructor certifications and licenses, each serving a distinct purpose in the world of fitness training. To avoid confusion, here is a detailed explanation of what each entails.",
			"Certification": {
				"Explanation": "An Instructor Certification is an individual qualification designed for fitness professionals who want to teach group fitness classes in their chosen Les Mills program. By attending our program events and passing the necessary assessments, you become a certified Les Mills Instructor. This certification demonstrates your expertise, knowledge, and ability to deliver safe and effective classes.",
				"Close": "While a certification qualifies you to teach, you can only hold classes in a facility that holds a Les Mills License. Certification alone does not permit you to operate independently or teach Les Mills programs in unlicensed establishments."
			},
			"License": {
				"Explanation": "A License is a business agreement that allows establishments (such as fitness clubs, gyms, or hotels) to legally offer Les Mills programs. It applies to the organization, not the individual instructor. A license grants a business the rights to include Les Mills programs in its fitness offerings. It is required for any establishment that wants to legally host classes taught by certified instructors.",
				"Feature": [
					"Facilities pay a licensing fee to use specific Les Mills programs.",
					"Licensed establishments ensure their instructors are trained and certified.",
					"Businesses receive quarterly updates (kits) with new music, choreography, and Masterclass videos to keep programs fresh and engaging."
				]

		"Hybrid": "This system is specifically designed for Turkey to allow Instructors to teach in boutique fitness studios, small hotels without branches, and open spaces. These businesses can utilize the instructors' licenses without paying additional licensing fees. In this system, the Instructor pays an annual license fee and receives a kit (Music, Choreography, and Master Class video) from us four times a year, every three months.",
		"Operation": "This system applies to fitness clubs with more than two branches, A-plus hotels, and hotel chains. Fitness clubs or hotels pay a licensing fee for the programs they wish to use and have their in-house Instructors trained. Once the Instructors are certified, they can teach the licensed programs owned by the business. Additionally, the business can hire Les Mills-certified Instructors to work for them. In this system, businesses pay for program license usage, Instructor Certification Training, and the Instructors' kit fees (Music, Choreography, and Master Class videos).",
